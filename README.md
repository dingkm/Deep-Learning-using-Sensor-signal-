research content when I was in intership in TOSHIBA R&D Center.
The theme is Performance analysis on sensor-integration based HAR learning model　
Human activity recognition, or **HAR**, is a challenging time series classification task.It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.
Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have shown capable and even achieve state-of-the-art results by automatically learning features from the raw sensor data.

This time, the dataset I used is **Heterogeneity Activity Recognition Data Set** from UCI. Here is some describution about the dataset.
>>The dataset contains the readings of two motion sensors commonly found in smartphones. Reading were recorded while users executed activities scripted in no specific order carrying smartwatches and smartphones.
Activities: ‘Biking’, ‘Sitting’, ‘Standing’, ‘Walking’, ‘Stair Up’ and ‘Stair down’.
Sensors: Sensors: Two embedded sensors, i.e., Accelerometer and Gyroscope, sampled at the highest frequency the respective device allows.
Devices: 4 smartwatches (2 LG watches, 2 Samsung Galaxy Gears)
8 smartphones (2 Samsung Galaxy S3 mini, 2 Samsung Galaxy S3, 2 LG Nexus 4, 2 Samsung Galaxy S+)
Recordings: 9 users
