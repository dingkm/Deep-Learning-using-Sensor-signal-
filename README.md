#The theme is Performance analysis on sensor-integration based HAR learning modelã€€
#Human activity recognition, or *HAR*, is a challenging time series classification task.It involves predicting the movement of a person based on sensor data and involves deep domain expertise and methods from signal processing to correctly engineer features from the raw data in order to fit a machine learning model.
#Recently, deep learning methods such as convolutional neural networks and recurrent neural networks have shown capable and even achieve state-of-the-art results by automatically learning features from the raw sensor data.
